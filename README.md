## Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography
### Project Description
This project implements image steganography to securely hide text messages inside images. It uses Python and OpenCV to modify pixel values, making the message invisible to the human eye. A password-based decryption mechanism ensures that only authorized users can retrieve the hidden information.

### What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within digital media, such as images, without altering the visible appearance. Unlike encryption, where data is converted into an unreadable format, steganography keeps the hidden message undetectable, making it more secure against unauthorized access.
